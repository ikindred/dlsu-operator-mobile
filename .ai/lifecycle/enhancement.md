# Lifecycle: Enhancement

## Goal

Improve existing behavior without uncontrolled scope growth.

## Steps

1. **Classify**: behavior-changing (enhancement) unless purely refactor.
2. **Clarify**:
   - what is being improved and how to measure “better”
   - what must not change
3. **Confirm gate**.
4. **Implement**:
   - keep within feature budget unless approved to exceed
5. **Tests**:
   - update/add tests if behavior is modified
6. **Verify** minimal set of checks.
